## 🔥 Alternative: Netlify Drop (Even Faster!)

## ❓ Why Can't I Just Open the File?

PWAs require HTTPS for security. The `file://` protocol doesn't support:
- Service Workers
- Install prompts
- Offline caching
- Push notifications

**That's why you need to deploy it to a web server first!**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Convert SVG Icons to PNG (Optional but Recommended)

For better compatibility, convert the SVG icons to PNG:

1. Open `icon-192.svg` in browser
2. Take screenshot or use online converter
3. Resize to exactly 192x192 pixels
4. Save as `icon-192.png`
5. Repeat for `icon-512.svg` → 512x512 → `icon-512.png`
6. Update `manifest.json` to reference `.png` files
7. Re-upload to GitHub/Netlify

### Test Locally with HTTPS

```bash
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Navigate to your folder
cd path/to/baby-tracker

# Run with HTTPS (creates self-signed cert)
http-server -S -C cert.pem -K key.pem

# Visit https://localhost:8080/baby_tracker_enhanced.html
```
